                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to create our Lab 15 pages after experimenting with jQuery and AJAX.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had a somewhat difficult time trying to get the API endpoint URLs to work and the output to display properly instead of saying "undefined" or not showing anything at all. I originally tried finding APIs that weren't provided on Canvas, too, but I couldn't get any to output on the lab page--at most, they'd appear in the console.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>My partner, Helwa Halloum, and I worked together on the lab at RCC dining hall. We discussed the tasks and gave each other advice when it was needed.</p>
