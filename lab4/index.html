			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create pseudocodes for an everyday task and a simple computer game, then turn the pseudocode for the computer game into javascript comments. We then had to include the pseudocodes and javascript comments into the lab page and style the website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit with the margins of my pseudocode lists (they wouldn't align to the left of the screen), but I fixed them by deleting all the indents in the HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My partner, Helwa Halloum, and I met up in the Rachel Carson computer lab and then the dining hall to work together on the pseudocodes and JS comments. We discussed what needed to go into the pseudocodes and helped each other with the layouts in the lab page. We put a lot of effort into making sure our pseudocodes were as accurate as possible and making sure our lab pages looked nice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully created our own pseudocodes for our everyday tasks and collaborated on a pseudocode for the game "Sticks". We also made nice layouts for our lab pages. (See below for pseudocodes and javascript comments.)</p>

<b>Creating a Sticks Game:</b>
	1.Title screen
	2. Accept user input to start game
	3. Await user input for players (players: 2)
	4. Accept user input (players: 2)
	5. Game start
	6. Players start with 2 hands, 1 finger each
	7. Accept player 1 move
	8. Validate player 1 move
		a. Tap 1 of the opponent’s hand to add 1 finger (point) to opponent’s hand
			i. If finger # is greater than 1
				• Then add finger # amount to opponent’s hand
		b. If player has even total # fingers, player can tap hands together to move half # fingers to other hand
			i. Player input: If finger # is 3 on one hand (3 & 1)
				• Then add additional finger to single finger hand (2 & 2)
			ii. Player input: If finger # is 4 on one hand (4 & “dead” hand)
				• Then split into 2 fingers on each hand (2 & 2)
	9. Evaluate possible moves from player 1
	10. Accept player 2 move
	11. Validate player 2 move
		a. Tap 1 of the opponent’s hand to add 1 finger (point) to opponent’s hand
			i. If finger # is greater than 1
				• Then add finger # amount to opponent’s hand
		b. If player has even total # fingers, player can tap hands together to move half # fingers to other hand

				• Then split into 2 fingers on each hand (2 & 2)
	12. Evaluate possible moves from player 2
	13. Test of win condition
		a. If a player’s hand reaches 5 finger count
			i. Then a player loses a hand
		b. If a player reaches 0 hands
			ii. Then player loses and opponent wins
