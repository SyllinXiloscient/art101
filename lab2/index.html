			<p>I am Daisy Ly, a second year Art & Design: Games + Playable Media student. My partner is Helwa Halloum, a senior in the same major. We met last year in one of our foundational courses and became quick friends after realizing we played the same game. I'm glad to still be her friend and working together with her on this lab!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, my partner and I had to write a paragraph about ourselves and insert it under a header labeled "Hello World." Then, we futher edited the HTML for the "challenges," "problems," "reflections," and "results" sections of the website. We edited CSS next, and inspected the HTML document for the heading of the site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our images wouldn't load when we published our website even though they loaded on the live server. We solved this by Q@09y452y85q</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My partner and I tried our hardest to complete the project and then do a little more than what the assignment on Canvas asked for. We struggled a lot with getting the images to load on the website, and kept re-editting the code
						Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We succeeded in creating our first HTML and CSS website!</p>
