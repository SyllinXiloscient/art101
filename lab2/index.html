			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<p>I am Daisy Ly, a second year Art & Design: Games + Playable Media student. My partner is Helwa Halloum, a senior in the same major. We met last year in one of our foundational courses and became quick friends after realizing we played the same game (Twisted Wonderland!!). I'm glad to still be her friend and working together with her on this lab!</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, my partner and I had to write a paragraph about ourselves and insert it under a header labeled "Hello World." Then, we futher edited the HTML for the "challenges," "problems," "reflections," and "results" sections of the website. Finally, we edited the CSS and inspected the HTML document for the heading of the site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our images wouldn't load when we published our website even though they loaded on the live server. We solved this by copying and pasting the code used to insert the image from our homepages and editing the necessary links, discovering that we needed "img class=" for it to work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My partner and I tried our hardest to complete the project requirements and then do a little more than what the assignment on Canvas asked for. (We added links to our homepages directing to the lab pages, and vice-versa.) We struggled a lot with getting our images to load on the website and therefore kept re-editing the code until we ultimately copied the code from the homepage to see if it would work when linked with the new image, and it did!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We succeeded in creating our first website with HTML and CSS!</p>
